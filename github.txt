How to make new repository on Github
================================================

### Make new repository on Github first.
- (remote) Make a new repository on Github
- (local) clone existing repository on Github by using clone command.
$ git local clone https://gkithub.com/RioKKH/python_example.git

Add files you would like to commit on that blanch.
$ git add <file1> <file2> ...
$ git commit
or you can do this like below, too.
$ git commit -m "comment"
$ git branch -M main
then push your local repository to remote.
$ git push origin main

if you are working on sub-branch and would like to update the sub-branch on github, then run following command.
$ git push origin HEAD or <branch_name>

### Make new repository on your local first then push it to Github
$ git init
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "My first commit"
- To avoid typing an address of repository repeatedly, make an alias by using "remote add" command.
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/RioKKH/c_example.git
- Then push it to rremote-master.
$ git push -u origin master
- The meaning of "-u" is to add "origin master" to your reference and from next push, you just need to run like below.
$ git push

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/RioKKH/MPI_example.git
git push -u origin main

or maybe you can make remote branch by the following way.
$ git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>


If you would like to add another new branch to upstream, then run following command.
$ git push --set-upstream origin develop
